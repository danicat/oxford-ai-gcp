This is the supporting material for my talk "Data Engineering on GCP" presented at Oxford University as part of the course "Artificial Inteligence: Cloud and Edge Implementations": https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/artificial-intelligence-cloud-and-edge-implementations

## Setup

Create a python3 virtual env before running any of the sample code:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

If the module `python3-venv` is not available, you may need to install it.

On Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

To active the environment, use:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

With the virtual env activated, install the requirements file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the environment, after finishing your work, use the command `deactivate`.
